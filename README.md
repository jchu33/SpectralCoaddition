# SpectralCoaddition
This repository contains several files that comprise the spectral co-addition process. Spectral co-addition essentially adds the fluxes of many objects to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and enhance spectral features such as emission lines. Before spectral co-addition can be employed, the data must first be normalized and rebinned (make sure all data have uniform wavelength scales). Then, we co-added the data using inverse variance weighting and sigma clipping techniques.
